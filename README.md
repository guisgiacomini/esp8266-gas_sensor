# Creating a gas leakage detector with ESP-8266

**IMPORTANT:** This is a project for educative purposes and to help people learn the basics about electronic circuits and the Internet of Things. **PLEASE** do not use this as a reliable tool for ensuring your safety.

## Introduction

Here, we will build a small electronic circuit using the ESP-8266 microcontroller, which offers the possibility to connect and use Wi-Fi functionalities. The objective is to use a sensor to detect gas leaks and trigger a digital alarm via WhatsApp notification. It will also include alarms via sound and LED blinking. To be able to receive WhatsApp messages, we are going to use the [CallMeBot API](https://www.callmebot.com/)
